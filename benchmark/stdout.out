>> Initialization starts. ( Preprocessing of the input QMC correlations )

>> Initialization finished in 5.03 s.

>> The annealing starts with the following parameters :

           Number of QMC img-time points     ->             160
                     Inverse temperature     ->            8.00
                      Number of QMC bins     ->            1000
         Pace of re-bin for the QMC data     ->               1
             Number of bootstrap samples     ->            5000

                  Type of the SAC kernel     ->         fermion
                  Type of the MC updates     ->          single

   Number of img-time points (truncated)     ->             159
    Initial sampling temperature 'theta'     ->        1.00e+06
                          Annealing rate     ->            0.90
         Pace of numerical stabilization     ->              10
               Number of delta functions     ->            1000
                      Number of SAC bins     ->               5
        Number of samples in one SAC bin     ->            4000
        MC steps to collect the spectrum     ->          100000

         Interval of the hyperfine grids     ->        1.00e-05
          Interval of the spectral grids     ->        1.00e-02
         Frequency range of the spectrum     ->   -10.00, 10.00
