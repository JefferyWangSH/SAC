# Stochastic Analytic Continuation [![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/works-on-my-machine.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)


Primary C++ implementation of Stochastic Analytic Continuation method `(SAC)`,
proposed by Anders W. Sandvik, is presented in this repository. 

The program is aimed to extract information of fermion spectrum functions from imaginary-time quantum Monte Carlo `(QMC)` data. 
More details about `SAC` algorithm can be found in [references](#references).
