# Stochastic-Analytic-Continuation
* Stochastic Analytic Continuation (SAC) method.
* Calculate real-frequency information from imaginary-time quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) data.


# TODO: some problems are list here
   
* 1. A(\omega) = A(-\omega) ? if so, modify kernel matrix.
* 2. Displaced Green's functions obtained from QMC seem not to be anti-periodic.
* 3. Update scheme doesn't work if \omega = 0.
* 4. Regulate theta and nCst to obtain the most reasonable spectrum;
     different values of theta seem to have few influence on the goodness of fitting.
